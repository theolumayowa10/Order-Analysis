# Restaurant Orders Analysis 📊

This repository contains an analysis of restaurant orders using data from two CSV files: `orders.csv` and `menu_items.csv`. The goal is to uncover revenue trends, identify the best- and worst-selling items, and determine peak business hours.

## 📂 Dataset
- **orders.csv** - Contains details of customer orders, including date, time, and item IDs.
- **menu_items.csv** - Provides item names, categories, and prices.

## 🚀 Analysis Overview
We conducted the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning** - Removing missing values and ensuring correct date-time formatting.
2. **Data Enrichment** - Merging the orders data with menu item details.
3. **Revenue Calculation** - Adding tax and total revenue columns.
4. **Revenue Insights** - Identifying the best- and worst-performing menu items.
5. **Peak Business Hours** - Finding trends in order frequency using visualizations.

## 📊 Key Findings
- The highest revenue-generating items belong to the *Italian* and *Asian* categories.
- Peak ordering hours occur between **11 AM to 2 PM**, while late evenings see a drop in revenue.
- Saturdays and Sundays experience the highest order volumes.
- A heatmap was used to visualize revenue distribution by hour and day of the week.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Data visualization** (bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps)
